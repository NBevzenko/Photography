<u># Technology project at THRogers </u>

## This is a short summary of what this website is.

##### Our technology class is doing a unit where we study coding and creating websites. We started off with HTML, with some CSS for stylesheets, and finally to JavaScript to code a website. When finished, my website will display currently popular images from unsplash.com, and will update regularly. It will have 4 topics of photos, urban(citylife, grafitti, etc.), nature(animals, plants, life), and skies(night sky, sunset, sunrise, clouds). All of these topics will update regularly, as well as the home screen.
